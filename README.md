# Usva website

This is the frontend repository for [Usva](https://github.com/romeq/usva). 

## About

The current production instance can be found at [usva.cc](https://usva.cc) and it's hosted in [Vercel](https://vercel.com)



## Development

#### Configuration

Configuration is located in `config.ts` at the project root.

As you might notice, the only configuration is basically the backend location. Before any changes it's most definitely set to the current production instance- which is not the preferred location. For good development experience we recommend hosting your own local [Usva instance](https://github.com/romeq/usva).

#### Starting the server

```bash
npm run dev
# or if you prefer yarn,
yarn dev
```
